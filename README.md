# hibernate-schema-validation-failure Project

This project reproduces the issue described in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/24742

Before running the project, please start the spanner emulators using:
```shell script
docker-compose up
```
Two spanner emulators are started, one per datasource declared in `application.properties`.

Both emulator databases are initialized with the right schemas for each datasource / persistence unit.
This can be verified by opening a shell to the running images and executing the following commands.

In the spanner emulator image for the `default` datasource:
```shell script
gcloud spanner databases execute-sql car-rent --project=test-project --instance=test-instance --sql="SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='RentedCar'"
```
In the spanner emulator image for the `read-database` datasource:
```shell script
gcloud spanner databases execute-sql car --project=test-project --instance=test-instance --sql="SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='Car'"
```

Regardless of both databases containing the tables as expected, the Schema-validation fails at application start up with:

```
2022-04-08 14:22:29,067 ERROR [io.qua.hib.orm.run.sch.SchemaManagementIntegrator] (Hibernate post-boot validation thread for <default>) Failed to validate Schema: Schema-validation: missing table [RentedCar]
2022-04-08 14:22:29,119 ERROR [io.qua.hib.orm.run.sch.SchemaManagementIntegrator] (Hibernate post-boot validation thread for <default>) The following SQL may resolve the database issues, as generated by the Hibernate schema migration tool. WARNING: You must manually verify this SQL is correct, this is a best effort guess, do not copy/paste it without verifying that it does what you expect.

START BATCH DDL;
create table RentedCar (id STRING(255) not null,carId STRING(255),endDate DATE,startDate DATE) PRIMARY KEY (id);
RUN BATCH;
```
The issue is reproducible with both Quarkus versions 2.8.0.CR1 and 2.7.5.Final

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/hibernate-schema-validation-failure-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
